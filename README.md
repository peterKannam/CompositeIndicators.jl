# CompositeIndicators.jl

 CompositeIndicators.jl is a package for the building and analysis of composite indicator models. It is heavily influenced by the [COINr](https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINr/) package by William Becker.

The base functions for this package were used to compute and assess the [Chicago Environmental Justice Index](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/Environment/cumulative-impact-assessment.html).
